*Technical Challenge: AI Clinical Scribe Platform*

*Overview*

You will build a provider-facing AI clinical documentation platform. The
end user is a physician or clinical staff member. The core workflow: a
provider either pastes a raw encounter transcript (e.g. a verbatim record
of what was discussed during a visit), or types freeform clinical
observations, and the AI transforms that input into a structured,
professional SOAP note (Subjective, Objective, Assessment, Plan), including
suggested ICD-10 diagnosis codes based on the clinical content.

The product must feel polished enough that a real physician would trust it
with their clinical workflow.
------------------------------

*Core Requirements*

*Authentication and Multi-Role Access*

Implement a real login system with two distinct roles: Provider and Admin.
Providers can only see and interact with their own encounters. Admins can
view all providers' encounters, manage the provider roster, and modify note
templates. Hard-code at least three provider accounts and one admin account
for demo purposes. Use JWTs or session tokens, and be prepared to explain
every layer of your auth implementation.

*Encounter Workspace (Provider View)*

The main interface for a logged-in provider. They can:

   - Start a new encounter by entering the patient's first name, last name,
   and date of birth
   - Paste a raw encounter transcript or type freeform clinical
   observations into a text area
   - Click Generate Note, at which point the AI streams a structured SOAP
   note back in real time using server-sent events or WebSockets (no full-page
   reloads, no waiting for a complete response before rendering begins)
   - The generated SOAP note must include a Subjective section, an
   Objective section, an Assessment section with at least one suggested ICD-10
   code and description semantically matched to the clinical content, and a
   Plan section
   - The provider can edit the generated note inline before saving
   - Save the finalized note to the database

*Patient History and Context Injection*

When a provider starts an encounter for a patient who already has prior
saved notes in the system (matched by first name, last name, and DOB), the
AI must automatically retrieve and inject that patient's prior encounter
history as context when generating the new SOAP note. The AI should
reference relevant prior diagnoses or treatments where clinically
appropriate. This retrieval must happen via a backend tool or function call
during generation, not by stuffing prior notes into the frontend prompt.
The AI should demonstrably behave differently for a returning patient
versus a first-time patient.

*Note Versioning and Audit Trail*

Every time a provider edits and re-saves a note, a new version must be
written to the database. The prior version must never be overwritten or
deleted. Providers can view the full version history of any note, including
who saved each version and at what time. This version history must be
stored in and retrieved from AWS RDS, not in memory or in a flat file.

*ICD-10 Code Search*

Implement a standalone ICD-10 search widget within the encounter workspace.
The provider can type a symptom or condition in plain English, and the
system returns the top semantically relevant ICD-10 codes using either a
vector similarity approach or an AI call. The provider can click any result
to append it to the Assessment section of the open note. Hard-code or embed
a reasonably sized subset of ICD-10 codes (at minimum 200 to 300 entries)
to power this. Do not rely on an external ICD-10 API.

*Admin Dashboard*

A separate view accessible only to Admin accounts. Must support:

   - Viewing all encounters across all providers, filterable by provider
   and date range
   - Adding and deactivating provider accounts
   - Managing a library of note templates, which are structured prompts
   that shape how the AI generates SOAP notes for different encounter types
   (e.g. orthopedic follow-up vs. new patient evaluation vs. urgent care
   visit). Admins can create, edit, and delete templates. Providers select a
   template before generating a note, and the AI must visibly behave
   differently depending on which template is active.
   - Changes to templates must take effect immediately. If a provider has
   the encounter workspace open and the admin updates the active template, the
   next generation the provider runs must use the new template without
   requiring a page refresh.

*Session Persistence*

If a provider is mid-encounter (transcript entered, note not yet saved) and
refreshes the page or closes and reopens the browser, the in-progress draft
must be restored from the database. The provider should be able to continue
exactly where they left off. This must work across devices, meaning that
logging in from a different browser should restore the same draft state.

*Non-Happy-Path Scenarios*

Your system must handle at least two non-happy-path scenarios and
demonstrate both in your walkthrough. Examples: a provider submits a
transcript that contains no clinically meaningful content (the AI should
respond gracefully rather than generate a hallucinated SOAP note); a
provider attempts to save a note while their session has expired (handle
this without data loss); an admin deactivates a provider account while that
provider has a draft open (define and implement a reasonable behavior). You
choose the two scenarios, but they must be substantive and clearly
demonstrated.
------------------------------

*Infrastructure Requirements*

   - Hosted on AWS EC2. The application must be accessible over HTTPS with
   a valid SSL certificate. Self-signed certs are not acceptable.
   - All persistent data, including encounters, note versions, patients,
   providers, templates, and audit logs, must live in AWS RDS (PostgreSQL or
   MySQL). No SQLite, no local files, no in-memory stores for anything that
   needs to survive a server restart.
   - Your schema must be normalized and defensible. You will be asked to
   walk through your ERD during the code review portion of the video.
   - Implement database connection pooling correctly. Your EC2 instance
   must not open a new DB connection on every request.
   - All environment secrets (DB credentials, API keys) must be managed via
   AWS Secrets Manager or Parameter Store. No hardcoded credentials anywhere
   in the codebase, including in .env files committed to the repo.
   - Your EC2 instance must sit behind a reverse proxy such as nginx. The
   application process must not be directly exposed on port 80 or 443.
   - Your RDS instance must not be publicly accessible. It must only accept
   connections from within the VPC. Be prepared to demonstrate this in your
   code walkthrough.

------------------------------

*Evaluation Criteria*

   - Correctness and reliability of the core AI scribe workflow end to end
   - Streaming implementation: does note generation render progressively,
   or does it feel like a spinner followed by a content dump?
   - Database design: schema quality, normalization, indexing decisions,
   and whether you can defend every table and relationship
   - Infrastructure rigor: secrets management, VPC isolation of RDS,
   connection pooling, reverse proxy configuration
   - UI quality: this must look like something a physician would actually
   open. Clinical tool aesthetics are clean, dense, and high-trust, not
   consumer-app bubbly.
   - Prioritization: does the build feel complete even if some features are
   unfinished, or does it feel broken in obvious places?
   - Non-happy-path handling: are edge cases handled gracefully, or do they
   produce errors or nonsensical AI output?
   - Code walkthrough quality: can you explain every architectural decision
   clearly, including why you chose your AI model and how you structured your
   prompts?

This is intentionally a large scope. We do not expect every feature to be
perfect. We expect the core scribe workflow, streaming, RDS persistence,
and infrastructure requirements to be airtight, and we expect the rest to
be prioritized intelligently. An incomplete build that feels finished to a
user and has a solid infrastructure foundation will outscore a complete
build with sloppy infrastructure and a broken UI.
------------------------------

*Pioneer Features*

You will stand out if you build one or two features not described above.
Strong candidates have added things like: provider-specific writing style
learning, where the AI adapts to how a specific provider tends to phrase
their notes over time based on their history in the database; automatic
flagging of clinical red flags in the transcript before note generation; a
diff view between note versions so providers can see exactly what changed;
or a bulk export of all encounters for a given patient across all visits as
a single structured PDF.
